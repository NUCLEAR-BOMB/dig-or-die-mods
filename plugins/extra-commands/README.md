# Extra Commands

A plugin that expands the list of available commands (chat messages starting with `/`).

## Argument Specification

### Relative coordinates

Relative coordinates start with a tilde (`~`), optionally followed by a number (which can be negative).
They describe an offset from the current player position along one of the world axes.
A tilde (`~`) alone assumes an offset of 0.
They can represent a single-precision floating point number or an integer.

Examples:
```
/tp ~10 ~
```
> Teleports the player right (+X) by 10 cells. Note that the Y position stays the same.

```
/tp ~-5 ~-2
```
> Teleports the player down (-Y) by 5 cells and left by 2 cells (-X).

---

### Cursor coordinates

Format of coordinates that refer to the current mouse position.
Their format starts with caret (`^`), optionally followed by a number (which can be negative), representing an offset.
They describe an absolute position of the mouse in the world along an axes, plus some provided offset.
A standalone caret (^) assumes an offset of 0.
They can represent a single-precision floating-point number or an integer.

> [!NOTE]
> You can mix relative and cursor coordinates in the same command.

Examples:
```
/tp ^ ^
```
> Teleport to the position pointing by the mouse.

```
/tp ^5 ^
```
> Teleports player to the position pointing by the mouse plus additional offset in right (X+) direction in 5 cells.

### Format language specifications

A string enclosed in `<` and `>` denotes an argument type defined in this list.

A string enclosed in `[` and `]` denotes an optional argument inside it.

---

### `UNIT-POSITION`

Represents a two-dimensional coordinate composed of X and Y values.
Each value must be a single-precision floating-point number, a relative coordinate, or a cursor coordinate.
Note: the position must be within the world boundaries for units (the `SWorld.GridRectM2` grid).

---

### `CELL-POSITION`

Represents a two-dimensional coordinate composed of X and Y values.
Each value must be a integer number, a relative coordinate, or a cursor coordinate.
Note: the position must be within the world boundaries for cells.

---

### `ITEM-ID`

Describes an item as an ID (a non-negative number).
The "null" item (ID 0) does not represent a valid item which can be carried in the inventory, instead, it represents an empty cell (e.g., a cell containing air).
Commands will throw an error if the "null" item is given to the inventory.

**Examples:** `#3` ("Miniaturizor MK III"), `#123` ("Cactus Dirt").

---

### `ITEM`

Describes an item.

Format:
- **Item code name** (e.g., `dirt` ("Dirt"), `gunParticlesShotgun` ("Particle Shotgun")). These correspond to static variables in the game's `GItems` class.
- **Item ID** in the format `#<ITEM-ID>`.
- `air`. Custom item with ID 0.

---

### `<INT>`

Describes an integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647 (or C#'s `int`/`System.Int32` type).

> [!NOTE]
> This type is parsed with `int.TryParse` in C#.

---

If the parameter name is not in this list, the command will return an error.

> [!NOTE]
> The `bool` type has the format `true`, `True` and `1` string for `true` value and `false`, `False` and `0` for `false` value.
> 
> The `Color24` type has the format `red:green:blue` (`red`, `green` and `blue` are `byte`s) or `uint` representing a concatenation of these values.
