# Enable Asserts

Basic plugin that makes built-in game's assertion mechanism functional (function `SMisc.Assert`).

Useful for finding bugs and debugging the game.

## Configuration

### `IsFatal`

**Setting Type:** `bool` \
**Default value:** `true`

When an assertion fails, the game process terminates immediately with an error code of `1`.
